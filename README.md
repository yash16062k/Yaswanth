# 👋 Hey, I'm Yaswanth Swarna

I’m a passionate Software Engineer in building secure full-stack applications and automating cybersecurity workflows. I enjoy working at the intersection of **Python development**, **security engineering**, and **data analytics** to build systems that are not only functional but also secure and insightful.

Right now, I’m focusing on developing backend services using **Flask**, **FastAPI**, and **Spring Boot**, while using **React.js** for building clean and responsive frontends. I’ve also been working a lot with tools like **Okta**, **Burp Suite**, **ZAP**, and **Active Directory** to streamline IAM and vulnerability management.

I’m comfortable working in cloud environments like **AWS** and using **CI/CD pipelines** with **Azure DevOps**, **Git**, and **Jenkins**. For analytics and reporting, I regularly use **Power BI**, **Tableau**, and **Splunk** to visualize security trends and log data.

### 🛠️ Tech I Use Often

- **Languages & Frameworks:** Python, Java, C++, Flask, FastAPI, Spring Boot, React.js, TypeScript  
- **Security & IAM:** JWT, OAuth2, Okta, MFA/SSO, AD, OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite  
- **Data & Infra:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Power BI, Tableau, Splunk, AWS, Terraform  
- **DevOps:** Git, Jenkins, Docker, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps

### 🧠 A Few Things I’ve Built

- `SecureLogix` – Flask + Splunk-based threat insights and log analytics pipeline  
- `IAM Analytics Dashboard` – Login trend visualizer using Power BI + Okta  
- `VulnTracker` – Python-based OWASP scanner with automated reporting
